    User: Hi there! I'd like to create a new playlist for my upcoming road trip. Can you help me with that?

    Playlist Manager: Of course! I'd be happy to assist you. What would you like to name your new playlist?

    User: How about "Road Trip Vibes"?

    Playlist Manager: Great choice! "Road Trip Vibes" it is. Any specific genre or mood you're looking for in this playlist?

    User: I'm thinking something upbeat and energetic, maybe a mix of pop and rock.

    Playlist Manager: Got it! I'll include a mix of pop and rock songs to keep the energy up. How long would you like the playlist to be?

    User: I think a 3-hour playlist should be perfect for the trip.

    Playlist Manager: Excellent! I'll make sure to curate a 3-hour playlist with upbeat pop and rock tracks. Anything else you'd like to add, such as specific artists or years?

    User: Hmm, how about some classic rock from the '70s and '80s? And include some tracks from Queen and Journey if possible.

    Playlist Manager: Sure thing! I'll add classic rock hits from the '70s and '80s, along with some tracks from Queen and Journey. Anything else before I finalize the playlist?

    User: No, that sounds perfect! Thanks for your help.

    Playlist Manager: You're welcome! I'll get to work on creating "Road Trip Vibes" for you. Once it's ready, I'll notify you. Enjoy your road trip!

    User: Thanks a bunch! Looking forward to it.
